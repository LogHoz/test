Images for Plughole
===================

These are the masters for the Plughole images.

Sizes
=====

The scaled images must fit into the game grid.  The game grid is 24 x 36, and of course will be scaled to screen size.  On various displays the cell sizes work out as follows:

		Screen		Board		Cell
	Kogan	320	240	320	213	8.89
	G1	480	320	480	320	13.33
	VGA	640	480	640	426	17.78
	WVGA	800	480	720	480	20

The sizes in cells of the various on-screen objects are stated in LevelData.java.  Note that these are overall pixmap sizes, for for e.g. holes, the actual hole size is less.

To make bitmaps scale nicely, make them 32 pixels per cell.  So for a ball 2 cells across, make the image 64 pixels across.
