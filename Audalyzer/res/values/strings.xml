    <string name="eula_text">Audalyzer is a toy spectrum analyser for
your phone.  Since microphone sensitivity varies between individual devices,
let alone models, it\'s impossible to generate accurate sound level readings
with this app; so all data should be taken with a pinch of salt.  dB levels
are relative to the maximum input level of your device.  Still, it may be
interesting when used to compare sound readings at different locations.\n\
