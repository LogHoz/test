<p><b>Hermit Android</b> is a collection of useful classes for
Android applications, in a library which can be linked into Android
projects.  This project is structured as the library itself, in the
<tt>lib</tt> directory, embedded within an Android project which
implements a simple test application.</p>

<p>Currently, Android does not have any facility for including Android
projects in other Android projects.  In particular, there can't be
any resources in included projects.  So, Hermit Android has been
kept clean of any defined resources -- it doesn't define any strings
of its own, for example.  When using Hermit Android, you must include
only the <tt>lib</tt> directory, and you should include it using
the "Link Source" feature in the Java Build Path settings.</p>
