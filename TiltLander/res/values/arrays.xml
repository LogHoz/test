<item><b>Tilt Lander</b> is a simple game which requires you to land
the lunar module safely on a small landing pad on the moon.  You have
to touch down gently, you have to land level, and you have to do it
before running out of fuel!\n\
\n\
This app is mainly a simple accelerometer demo; if you find if fun
to play, all the better.\n\
\n\
Land the lander on the green landing pad.  Touch the screen
to fire the engines; you have to be going slow and level when you land, but
watch your fuel (green bar at top left).  Tilt the device left and right to
steer.\n\
\n\
Use the menu to select different skill levels, pause the game, or start a new
game.</item>

<item>Tilt Lander is controlled by the touch screen and the
accelerometer (i.e. tilting the phone).</item>

<item>Tilt Lander has three skill levels.  Higher skill levels
have larger boards, and the most advanced levels have some special features:\n\
\n\
• <b>Easy</b> gives you plenty of fuel, a larger landing pad, and is less
discriminating about how hard and straight you land.\n\
\n\
• <b>Normal</b> level has medium fuel and landing pad.\n\
\n\
• <b>Hard</b> level cuts down your available fuel, uses a smaller
landing pad, requires you to be landing more slowly, and starts you
off moving at a higher speed.</item>

<item>The device\'s \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number
of options:\n\
• <b>New Game</b> starts a new game, abandoning the current game if any.\n\
• <b>Pause</b> pauses the game in progress.  Tap the screen
to un-pause.\n\
• <b>Skill Level</b> prompts you to select a skill level, then starts
a new game at that skill level.\n\
• <b>Invert tilt</b> reverses the way the lander turns when you tilt
the phone.\n\
• <b>Help</b> displays this help.\n\
• <b>About</b> displays version and license information.</item>
