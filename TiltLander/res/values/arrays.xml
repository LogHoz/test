<item><b>Tilt Lander</b> is a simple game which requires you to land
the lunar module safely on a small landing pad on the moon.  You have
to touch down gently, you have to land level, and you have to do it
before running out of fuel!\n\
\n\
This app is mainly a simple accelerometer demo; if you find if fun
to play, all the better.\n\
\n\
Land the lander on the green landing pad.  Touch the screen
to fire the engines; you have to be going slow and level when you land, but
watch your fuel (gauge at top right).  Tilt the device left and right to
steer.\n\
\n\
Use the menu to select different skill levels, pause the game, or start a new
game.</item>

<item>Tilt Lander is controlled by the touch screen and the
accelerometer (i.e. tilting the phone).  Tilting the device rotates the lander
and touching the screen fires the engines; firing the engines pushes you
in whatever direction the lander is pointing.  So, to control your descent,
you will need a combination of careful steering and well-timed engine
use.  As you don\'t have much fuel, finesse is key.\n\
\n\
The direction that the lander turns in response to tilting the device
can be changed in the settings; see \"Settings\" below.  You can press the
device\'s menu button at any time to pause.  (It also lets you in to the
menu; see \"Menu\" below.)\n\
\n\
To win, you have to land on the landing pad marked in light blue.  You
have to be completely on the pad.  You also have to be moving quite slowly,
and you have to be level, or nearly level.\n\
\n\
The three gauges at the top of the screen are designed to help you adjust
your landing.  The left gauge is speed; it will be green when your speed
is below the maximum landing speed, and otherwise coloured to show how fast
you are.  You don\'t have to be green all the way down — you may find that
saving fuel for last-minute engine burns helps — but this gauge must be
green when you touch down.\n\
\n\
The centre gauge shows how level you are.  Again, green is a safe angle for
landing; you can tilt as much as you like on the way down, but you must
have this gauge green to land.\n\
\n\
The right-hand gauge is your fuel level.  It will warn you when you get low;
however, landing with no fuel left is fine, as long as you\'re slow and
level.\n\
\n\
Finally, note that speed includes both your horizontal and vertical speed.</item>

<item>Tilt Lander has three skill levels; you can select which level you
want to play at in the settings (see \"Settings\" below).  The levels are:\n\
\n\
• <b>Easy</b> gives you plenty of fuel, a larger landing pad, and is less
discriminating about how hard and straight you land.\n\
\n\
• <b>Normal</b> level has medium fuel and landing pad.\n\
\n\
• <b>Hard</b> level cuts down your available fuel, uses a smaller
landing pad, requires you to be landing more slowly, and starts you
off moving at a higher speed.</item>

<item>The device\'s \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number
of options:\n\
• <b>New Game</b> starts a new game, abandoning the current game if any.\n\
• <b>Settings</b> opens up the settings screen; see \"Settings\" below.\n\
• <b>Help</b> displays this help.\n\
• <b>About</b> displays version and license information.</item>
              
<item>Tilt Lander has a number of user-configurable options in its Settings
screen.  This screen is reached through the menu, as described under \"Menu\"
above.  The available settings are detailed in the following sections.</item>

<item><b>Skill level</b> sets the game difficulty; see \"Skill Levels\"
above.</item>

<item><b>Invert tilt control</b> switches the way the lander turns when
you tilt the device.  Normally, tilting right rotates clockwise; with
this option set, tilting right rotates anti-clockwise.</item>

<item><b>Screen orientation</b> determines whether and how the application
will switch its display between portrait and landscape:\n\
• <b>System default</b> — the system will determine the orientation based
on the task context.\n\
• <b>Portrait</b> — lock to portrait mode.\n\
• <b>Landscape</b> — lock to landscape mode.\n\
• <b>User preference</b> — the app will switch orientation according to
the global device settings.\n\
• <b>Device orientation</b> — follow the physical orientation of the device.\n\
\n\
<b>Keep device awake</b> tells the application to keep the screen active
until the user manually leaves the application.  This is useful if you don\'t
want the screen to time out; however, be aware that it will quickly drain
your battery.</item>

<item><b>Show performance stats</b> tells Tilt Lander to display certain
performance statistics on-screen.  These stats are updated every 5
seconds and include frames per second, computation time, and
drawing time.</item>
