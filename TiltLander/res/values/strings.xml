    <string name="about_text"><b>Lunar Tilt Lander</b> based on the Android
Lunar Lander demo, with accelerometer support added by
Ian Cameron Smith (headstay).  This is mainly a simple accelerometer demo;
if you find if fun to play, all the better.\n\nLand the lander on the
green landing pad.  Touch the screen
to fire the engines; you have to be going slow and level when you land, but
watch your fuel (green bar at top left).  Tilt the device left and right to
steer.\n\nFor more information and source code see
the project home page: http://code.google.com/p/tiltlander/\n\nCopyright
