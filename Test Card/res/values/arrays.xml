<item><b>Test Card</b> is a very simple screen test app for Android.  It
displays a simple test pattern which you can examine with a loupe.  Right now
it\'s geared towards letting you examine the pixel density and format
on your device.\n\
\n\
On many devices, the display will be utterly uninteresting.  However, on
some, notably AMOLED devices, the results — when viewed under magnification —
are much more interesting.  Comparing a Motorola Droid with a Nexus One,
for example, shows a significant difference in the display quality.</item>

<item>The display shows test patterns which are intended to let you see
the structure of individual pixels, and the effect that has on the
overall quality of the display.  Four main types of patterns are shown,
in a range of colours; the colours are labelled with their initial letters,
\"B\" being blue and \"K\" being black\n\
\n\
Two types of single-colour patterns are shown: dots and lines.  They are
shown multiple times at different offsets, so that if a screen has pixels with
different colour components — as some AMOLED displays — you can see how
the patterns look on different pixel alignments.  On some displays this will
have no effect, on others a very marked effect.\n\
\n\
Below this, two types of multi-colour patterns are shown: lines and dot grids.
The line blocks show vertical (top half) and horizontal (bottom half) blocks
made of lines of alternating colours; the dot grids show grids of dots
of the same colours.  The labels show which colours are used in each pattern,
so \"YCM\" is yellow, cyan and magenta.  Again, the patterns are shown
in different offsets to align with the pixel grids in different ways.</item>

<item>The device\'s \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number
of options:\n\
• <b>Settings</b> takes you to the settings screen; see \"Settings\" below.\n\
• <b>Help</b> displays this help.\n\
• <b>About</b> displays an about box, with links to the license and
the project home page.</item>

<item>Test Card has a number of user-configurable options in its Settings
screen.  This screen is reached through the menu, as described under \"Menu\"
above.  The available settings are:\n\
\n\
<b>Keep device awake</b> tells the application to keep the screen active
until the user manually leaves the application.  This is useful if you want
to set Test Card up to continually display your sound level over a long
period; however, be aware that it will quickly drain your battery.</item>

<item>If you would like more information and help with Test Card, or if you
want to to report a bug, there are some on-line
resources which may be of interest, as described in the following
sections.</item>

<item>If you want to report a bug, you can use the Moonblink Issue tracker.
Before you post, <b>please</b> look through the existing issues -- including
closed issues -- before raising a new one.  Your problem may already have been
solved.\n\
\n\
If you do need to raise a new issue:\n\
• The issue tracker is used by a number of projects.  Please click on the
\"Product-\" label to set the product you are reporting against.  You can
also set the other fields as appropriate.\n\
• Please tell me what device, and what version of Android, you are using.\n\
• If the bug is a crash, then please attach a log if you possibly can.
If you don\'t know how, don\'t sweat it.\n\
