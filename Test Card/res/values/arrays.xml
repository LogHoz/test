<item><b>Test Card</b> is a very simple screen test app for Android.  It
displays a simple test pattern which you can examine with a loupe.  Right now
it's geared towards letting you examine the pixel density and format
on your device.</item>
			  
<item>The device\'s \"menu\" button pops up a menu containing a number
of options:\n\
• <b>Settings</b> takes you to the settings screen; see \"Settings\" below.\n\
• <b>Help</b> displays this help.\n\
• <b>About</b> displays an about box, with links to the license and
the project home page.</item>
              
<item>Test Card has a number of user-configurable options in its Settings
screen.  This screen is reached through the menu, as described under \"Menu\"
above.  The available settings are:\n\
\n\
<b>Keep device awake</b> tells the application to keep the screen active
until the user manually leaves the application.  This is useful if you want
to set Test Card up to continually display your sound level over a long
period; however, be aware that it will quickly drain your battery.</item>
