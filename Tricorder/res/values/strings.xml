    <string name="help_text"><b>Tricorder</b>\n\
\n\
Tricorder displays real data from the sensors built into your phone.\n\
\n\
This screen displays brief help on Tricorder.  For the full manual,
press \"manual\" below.\n\
\n\
<b>CONTROLS</b>\n\
\n\
Select between the available data views (see VIEWS below) using the buttons
on the left.\n\
\n\
In the GRAV and MAG views:\n\
• touch the X/Y axis plot to switch between absolute and relative modes.
When you enter relative mode, the current values are stored; the plot
starts displaying changes relative to those values.  So, for example, in
GRAV, touch to enter relative mode, and then you will see accelerations
relative to that initial state.\n\
• slide your finger up and down on the Magnitude graph to zoom the graph.\n\
• touch the numeric data display to toggle it to an X/Y/Z graph plot; red
is X, green is Y, and blue is Z.\n\
\n\
In the GEO view, touch the \"GPS Pwr\" button at the top-right to turn the
GPS on and off.\n\
\n\
In the EMS view, touch the \"WiFi Pwr\" button at the top-right to turn the
GPS on and off.\n\
\n\
<b>VIEWS</b>\n\
\n\
<b>GRAV</b> shows the local gravitational field, showing the individual
components on an X/Y plot and a vertical gauge for the Z axis.  Additionally
an altitude gauge shows the angle above or below the tricorder\'s horizontal
plane.  Below this the absolute magnitude of the gravitational field
is graphed, and then the raw numeric data is displayed, in units of m/s²:
\"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\" are the acceleration values in each of the three
dimensions; \"Az\" is the direction of the gravitational field in the X-Y
plane; \"Alt\" is the elevation of the gravitation pull above or below
the horizontal, in degrees; and \"Mag\" is the absolute magnitude of the
gravitational field, in units of m/s².  When this becomes zero,
you are in free fall.\n\
\n\
<b>MAG</b> shows the local magnetic field, in the same format.  The X-Y plot
can be used like a compass; keep the altitude at zero to see exactly which
way the magnetic field is pointing.  The values displayed are in micro-Tesla.\n\
\n\
<b>ENV</b> shows some environmental sensor readouts: light level, object
proximity, and temperature.  Each graph\'s header shows the current value
in numeric form.  Light readings are in lux; proximity is measured in metres;
temperature is in degrees celsius.\n\
\n\
Note that the values of these sensors can only be displayed
if your device actually has the sensors equipped (the G1 phone, sadly,
does not).  If the sensors are missing, simulated data can be displayed; see
the preferences for this option.  A blue indicator in the header for each
sensor indicates when it is in simulation mode.\n\
\n\
<b>GEO</b> shows geographic information from the various providers which
your device has.  \"Cellular\" displays location from the cellular phone network;
\"GPS\" is the GPS location, if GPS is enabled.  At the top-right corner you
will see a \"GPS Pwr\" button which turns the GPS on and off.\n\
\n\
Locations are shown in latitude and longitude degrees and minutes, with
fractional minutes.  \"Alt\" is the altitude in metres, and \"Acc\" is the
estimated accuracy of
the fix in metres.  If the location provider provides course data,
then \"Head\" is the direction you are moving in, and \"Spd\" is your speed
in metres per second.\n\
\n\
The latest available fix data, if there is any, will always be displayed.
Note that this data may be old.  The data is coloured to indicate its
age, and the age is also shown in the header bar for each location
provider.\n\
\n\
<b>EMS</b> scans the electromagnetic spectrum for
radio signals (as supported by hardware).  Detected signals are shown
as strength bars and a numeric strength indicator -- zero is no signal
(or too weak to be useful); 31 is maximum for cellular, and 41 seems to be
maximum for WiFi.  At the top-right corner you
will see a \"WiFi Pwr\" button which turns the WiFi on and off.\n\
\n\
For cellular, we display the cell ID, the network provider, and the
signal strength above the strength bar.  For WiFi networks, we display
the frequency in GHz, network ID, and signal strength.  The WiFi data
is refreshed periodically; the age of the displayed WiFi data is shown
in the WiFi header bar.\n\
\n\
In the preferences you can enable WiFi ping.  With this on, the device
will ping after each WiFi network scan; an echo ping
indicates the strength of the strongest detected signal.  (No echo means
no detected WiFi.)\n\
\n\
<b>MENU</b>\n\
\n\
The \"menu\" button gets you to the program settings, the
help screen (this one), and the about box.  In settings, you can set the
basic sound level to off, quiet, or loud (note that you can also control the
sound volume using the hardware volume keys).  You can enable WiFi ping;
see \"EMS\" above.  And you can enable simulation of data for missing
sensors; see \"ENV\" above.\n\
\n\
<b>GENERAL</b>\n\
\n\
Note that the availability and accuracy of the information
presented depends
on the underlying hardware.  In particular the magnetic field data is known
to be unreliable on some currently available devices, and the gravity reading
can be affected by playing music.\n\
