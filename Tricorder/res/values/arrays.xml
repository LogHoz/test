<item>Tricorder displays real data from the sensors built into your device.\n\
\n\
The following sections describe how to use Tricorder, and how to interpret
the displays.  For further information, see the "About" box, which contains
a link to the project home page.</item>

<item>Select between the available data views (see Views below) using the buttons
on the left.\n\
\n\
In the GRAV and MAG views:\n\
• touch the X/Y axis plot to switch between absolute and relative modes.
When you enter relative mode, the current values are stored; the plot
starts displaying changes relative to those values.\n\
• touch the numeric data display to toggle it to an X/Y/Z graph plot; red
is X, green is Y, and blue is Z.\n\
\n\
In the GEO view, touch the satellite display to change its mode.\n\
\n\
In the EMS view, touch the \"WiFi Pwr\" button at the top-right to turn the
WiFi on and off.\n\
\n\
In the SOL view, touch the \"Mode Alt\" button at the top-right to display
different information; tap the Sun image to see different Sun views.</item>

<item>Tricorder has multiple views, which you can switch between
using the buttons on the left.  Each view displays a particular type of
information, as detailed in the sections below.</item>

<item>@array/help_screens_texts</item>

<item>The \"menu\" button gets you to the program settings, the
help screen (this one), and the about box.  In settings, you can set the
basic sound level to off, quiet, or loud (note that you can also control the
sound volume using the hardware volume keys).  You can enable WiFi ping;
see \"EMS\" above.  You can set your preferences for how the display
rotates, or not.</item>

<item>Note that the availability and accuracy of the information
presented depends
on the underlying hardware.  In particular the magnetic field data is known
to be unreliable on some currently available devices, and the gravity reading
can be affected by playing music.\n\
\n\
You\'ll see a link to the project
home page at the bottom of this screen; check it out for more info on
Tricorder.  Tricorder is an open project, so if you want to join in and
make contributions, you can.  See the project page for information.</item>

<item><b>GRAV</b> shows the local gravitational field, showing the individual
components on an X/Y plot and a vertical gauge for the Z axis.  Additionally
an altitude gauge shows the angle above or below the tricorder\'s horizontal
plane.  Below this the absolute magnitude of the gravitational field
is graphed, and then the raw numeric data is displayed, in units of m/s²:
\"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\" are the acceleration values in each of the three
dimensions; \"Az\" is the direction of the gravitational field in the X-Y
plane; \"Alt\" is the elevation of the gravitation pull above or below
the horizontal, in degrees; and \"Mag\" is the absolute magnitude of the
gravitational field, in units of m/s².  When this becomes zero,
you are in free fall.</item>

<item><b>MAG</b> shows the local magnetic field, in the same format.  The X-Y plot
can be used like a compass; keep the altitude at zero to see exactly which
way the magnetic field is pointing.  The values displayed are in micro-Tesla.</item>
    
<item><b>ACO</b> performs an analysis of the local acoustic environment.  Displays
a waveform diagram, a frequency spectrum, and power level of the sound
as received by the device\'s microphone.\n\
\n\
The waveform and spectrum graphs auto-scale, so loud and quiet sounds can
both be displayed in a useful way.  The Power meter shows the power level
relative to the maximum possible input from the microphone, in dB; so
0dB is the maximum the device can register, -10dB is 1/10th of this, -20dB
is 1/100th of the max, etc.  The power meter also shows peak markers, and
a background bar displays a rolling average.  The rolling average is also
displayed numerically.</item>

<item><b>GEO</b> shows geographic information from the various providers which
your device has.  \"Cellular\" displays location from the cellular phone network;
\"GPS\" is the GPS location, if GPS is enabled.  Below these an indication
of the satellites in view is displayed; tap it to toggle between a sky diagram
and signal strength bars.  The sky diagram also indicates true north (not
magnetic north, although the accuracy still depends on your device\'s
magnetometer, which may not be great).\n\
\n\
Locations are shown in latitude and longitude degrees and minutes, with
fractional minutes.  \"Alt\" is the altitude in metres, and \"Acc\" is the
estimated accuracy of
the fix in metres.  If the location provider provides course data,
then \"Head\" is the direction you are moving in, and \"Spd\" is your speed
in metres per second.\n\
\n\
The latest available fix data, if there is any, will always be displayed.
Note that this data may be old.  The data is coloured to indicate its
age, and the age is also shown in the header bar for each location
provider.</item>

<item><b>EMS</b> scans the electromagnetic spectrum for
radio signals (as supported by hardware).  Detected signals are shown
as strength bars and a numeric strength indicator -- zero is no signal
(or too weak to be useful); 31 is maximum for cellular, and 41 seems to be
maximum for WiFi.  At the top-right corner you
will see a \"WiFi Pwr\" button which turns the WiFi on and off.\n\
\n\
For cellular, we display the cell ID, the network provider, and the
signal strength above the strength bar.  For WiFi networks, we display
the frequency in GHz, access mode, network ID, and signal
strength.  The access mode is blank for an open access point;
\'!\' for an ad-hoc network (beware!); \'*\' for WEP encryption;
\'#\' for WPA encryption; \'?\' for unknown.  The WiFi data
is refreshed periodically; the age of the displayed WiFi data is shown
in the WiFi header bar.\n\
\n\
In the preferences you can enable WiFi ping.  With this on, the device
will ping after each WiFi network scan; an echo ping
indicates the strength of the strongest detected signal.  (No echo means
no detected WiFi.)</item>

<item><b>SOL</b> displays information on the state of the Sun and solar wind.
This information is downloaded from the internet, and it\'s downloaded
as a very low-priority task so as not to affect your device\'s performance.
Hence, it may take some time for the information to actually appear.
At the top-right corner you will see a \"Mode Alt\" button
to toggle between two different display modes.\n\
\n\
The \'Protons\' graph displays low- (blue), medium- (yellow), and high-
(red) energy protons; the \'Electrons\' graph displays low- (blue) and high-
(red) energy electrons.  The \'Spots,Flares\' graph displays the numbers
of sunspots (red), optical flares (blue), and X-ray flares (purple).  The
Sun image shows images of the Sun in different wavelengths of light; tap it
to step through the available images.\n\
\n\
The Sun images are downloaded directly from SOHO.  If you see banner text
on the image, like \"CCD Bakeout\", this generally indicates that images
are unavailable as the satellite is doing a maintenance routine on the
camera.  Google \"CCD Bakeout\" for more (it\'s interesting).</item>
